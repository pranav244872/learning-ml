# Learning Machine Learning

Welcome to my journey into the world of Machine Learning! This repository serves as my learning ground where I explore various machine learning concepts and algorithms.

## What I've Learned So Far

### Linear Regression

In this repository, I've implemented a simple linear regression model from scratch using Python. Here's what I've covered:

- Implemented a cost function to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model.
- Implemented a Gradient Descent function to find the optimized values of \( w \) and \( b \).
- Utilized matplotlib for plotting the linear regression line.
- Explored the impact of the learning rate (alpha) and the number of iterations on model convergence and fit.

## Requirements

To run the code for linear regression, you'll need to install the following Python modules:

1. **matplotlib**: For plotting the linear regression line.
2. **numpy**: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
