# Learning Machine Learning

Welcome to my journey into the world of Machine Learning! This repository serves as my learning ground where I explore various machine learning concepts and algorithms.

## What I've Learned So Far

### Linear Regression

In this repository, I've implemented a simple linear regression model from scratch using Python. Here's what I've covered:

- Implemented a cost function to evaluate the performance of a linear regression model.
- Implemented a Gradient Descent function to find the optimized values of w and b.
- Wrote the function such that we give the values of w, b, learning_rate(alpha) and iterations, and the the line is plotted.
- Need to experiment with the learning_rate value and iterations to find a good fitting line for the data set
